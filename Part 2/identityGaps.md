## Identify Gaps / Questions for Product Team

1. **Product Ownership**
   - Do products belong to a specific company (company-specific catalog), or can the same product exist across multiple companies?

2. **Inventory Change Tracking**
   - What events should be tracked as inventory changes
  
3. **Supplier Relationship**
   - Can a supplier supply products to multiple companies?
   - Can a product have multiple suppliers?

4. **Bundles**
   - Are bundles pre-defined (fixed set of items) or can users customize bundle contents?
   - Should bundle stock be stored separately, or calculated from child product inventory?
